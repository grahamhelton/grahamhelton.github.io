# Using Cloud Credentials
Gaining access to the web application interface of managed Kubernetes services such as [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en), [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service), or [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is extremely powerful. It should go without saying that if you're able to login to the management interface of a cloud provider, you can access the cluster and cause chaos. Typically this would be done via phishing.

# Defending
Defending against unauthorized access to cloud console interfaces of managed Kubernetes services like GKE, AKS, or EKS involves several layers of security:

**Fundamental Defense**

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users accessing the cloud management interface. This adds an additional layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have compromised a user's credentials. For highly sensitive access, consider using hardware security keys for authentication. These devices provide a high level of protection against credential theft as it requires physical possession of the device to authenticate, making remote theft of credentials much more difficult. When a user tries to access a service, they must plug the security key into their device or connect it via NFC or Bluetooth, and press a button on the key. This action generates a unique, one-time use cryptographic signature that verifies the user's identity.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement strict RBAC policies that limit user permissions based on their role within the organization. Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their job functions.

**Regular Audits and Reviews:** Regularly audit access logs and review permission settings to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts or inappropriate permission grants. Major cloud platforms often provide tools to help identify risky privileges such as AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer or Google's Policy Analyzer for IAM policies for example.

  
**Mature Defense**

**Logging and Monitoring:** Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities quickly. Use security information and event management (SIEM) systems to aggregate logs and alert on anomalies.

**Infrastructure as code (IaC) for manageed Kubernetes services**: IaC helps prevent unauthorized access by standardizing and automating the deployment and configuration of cloud resources. IaC uses version-controlled and peer-reviewed scripts, which ensure that security configurations are consistently applied and that no unauthorized changes can be made without detection.

This approach reduces the risk of human error and configuration drift, which are common vulnerabilities in manual setups. By defining and enforcing security policies as code, organizations can ensure that only approved, compliant configurations are deployed, making unauthorized access more difficult. Additionally, the use of IaC enables quick response and remediation by allowing teams to redeploy known good configurations in response to a breach or misconfiguration, minimizing potential exposure.
